GRAPHS

Find shortest path in weighted graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm) -> use priority heap min heap:
(order the smallest elements first) - not implemented in .NET. Instead of that
it can be used - OrderedBag<T> in 	
 Wintellect's Power Collections for .NET -> extract the smallest value!!!


A* - modification of Dijkstra's algorithm -> using in GPS for finding the shortest path depends on
the traffic, speed limitations, obstacles on the road etc.


Topological Sorting -> use in directed graph

Minimum Spanning Tree ->
1) Prim's Algorithm - 
2) Kruskal's algorithm -
